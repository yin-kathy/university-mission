To develop a critical understanding of issues on marriage and family, biotechnology, and ethics in light of Western/modern assumptions regarding the human person, as these bear on the nature and dignity of human life and the transcendental meaning of beauty, truth, and goodness, in a way that fosters a unity of theory and practice at the service of the Church’s “new evangelization”;  3.	To offer accredited pontifical degree programs, as well as civilly accredited graduate degree programs (master’s, license, and doctoral-level education);  4.	To prepare graduates (laypersons, priests, and religious) for teaching and research in academic, seminary, and diocesan contexts; for work in legal, medical, and other professional occupations; and for evangelization of the family as the foundation for the development of a “culture of life” leading to the creation of a “civilization of love”; and  5.
